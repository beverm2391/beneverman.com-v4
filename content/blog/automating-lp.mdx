## Introduction

If you just need to solve one linear programming problem, do it in Excel with the [solver add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-solver-add-in-in-excel-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca). This is more of a proof of concept than a practical solution. Here's the flow:

1. Synthesize a linear programming problem with GPT-4 into a list of relevant variables and constraints.
2. Turn the list of variables and constraints into a list of arguments for a solver function, output in `json` format.
3. Parse the json into individual arguments for the solver function.
4. Pass the arguments to the solver function and return the solution.
5. Take the solution and apply it in the context of the original problem with GPT-4.

- **Total Runtime**: ~30-45 seconds.
- **Accuracy**: Fine for the dev/local environment, but not production.

## An Example Problem

>A company makes two products (X and Y) using two machines (A and B). Each unit of X that is produced requires 50 minutes processing time on machine A and 30 minutes processing time on machine B. Each unit of Y that is produced requires 24 minutes processing time on machine A and 33 minutes processing time on machine B.

>At the start of the current week there are 30 units of X and 90 units of Y in stock. Available processing time on machine A is forecast to be 40 hours and on machine B is forecast to be 35 hours.

>The demand for X in the current week is forecast to be 75 units and for Y is forecast to be 95 units. Company policy is to maximize the combined sum of the units of X and the units of Y in stock at the end of the week.

>Formulate the problem of deciding how much of each product to make in the current week as a linear program.

## The Automated Solution

Remember, you can follow along with the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15BgsUWqW4ugzWDkDzESCCoQ5vhwz17-k?usp=sharing).

If I run the code on this problem, I get a detailed output with the results of each step outline above. Here's the full output of the script, generated in about 30-45 seconds.

Analyzing problem and extracting arguments...
Intermediate Response:
1. The type of problem: Maximization (since the goal is to maximize profit)

2. The objective function: Let x be the number of pizzas and y be the number of root beers. The profit function is P(x, y) = 10x + 5y.

3. The constraints: 
   - 10x + 20y ≥ 100 (minimum daily requirement for vitamin A)
   - 30x + 10y ≥ 200 (minimum daily requirement for vitamin B)

4. The variables: x (number of pizzas) and y (number of root beers)

5. The bounds: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (since you cannot have negative quantities of pizza or root beer)
Unparsed args:
{
    "c": [-10, -5],
    "A_ub": [[10, 20], [30, 10]],
    "b_ub": [100, 200],
    "A_eq": null,
    "b_eq": null,
    "bounds": [[0, null], [0, null]]
}
Parsing args...
Running linear optimization...
Result: {'x': array([6., 2.]), 'fun': -70.0, 'slack': array([0., 0.]), 'success': True, 'message': 'Optimization terminated successfully. (HiGHS Status 7: Optimal)', 'nit': 2}
Interpreting result...
Final Response:

The result indicates that the optimal solution is to sell 6 pizzas and 2 root beers. This will maximize the profit, which is $70. The slack values of 0 for both constraints show that the minimum daily requirements for vitamins A and B are met exactly. The optimization was successful, and the optimal solution was found in 2 iterations.

## The Code

OpenAI Chat API and Linear Optimization Tutorial

This section provides documentation on how to use the codebase. It demonstrates how to interact with the Chat API to process user messages and generate responses using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. It also shows how to solve linear programming optimization problems using the `linear_optimization` function from the `scipy.optimize` library.

### Section of code
#### Class Chat
The `Chat` class is used to interact with the OpenAI Chat API. It initializes the class with the given parameters, such as temperature, system message, messages, model, and max tokens. The `__call__` method processes the user message and returns the assistant's response.

```python
class Chat:
    """
    A class to interact with the OpenAI Chat API.
    """

    def __init__(self, temperature=0.7, system_message="You are a helpful assistant.", messages=None, model='gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=2000):
        """
        Initialize the Chat class with the given parameters.
        """
        self.messages = []
        self.messages.append({"role": "system", "content": system_message})
        if messages is not None:
            self.messages += [{"role": "user", "content": message}
                              for message in messages]
        self.model = model
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens

    def __call__(self, user_message: str):
        """
        Process the user message and return the assistant's response.
        """

        user_message = {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        self.messages.append(user_message)
        raw_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=self.model,
            messages=self.messages,
            temperature=self.temperature,
            max_tokens=self.max_tokens,
        )
        text = raw_response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
        tokens = raw_response['usage']['total_tokens']
        res_message = {"role": "assistant", "content": text}
        self.messages.append(res_message)
        res_dict = {"response": text, "messages": self.messages,
                    "model": self.model, "temperature": self.temperature, "tokens": tokens}
        return res_dict
```

#### Function linear_optimization
The `linear_optimization` function solves a linear programming optimization problem using the highs algorithm. It takes the coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized (`c`), the inequality constraint matrix (`A_ub`), the inequality constraint vector (`b_ub`), and optional equality constraint matrix (`A_eq`), equality constraint vector (`b_eq`), and bounds for each variable (`bounds`). It returns a dictionary containing the optimal solution, the minimized objective function value, and the status of the optimization.

```python
def linear_optimization(c, A_ub, b_ub, A_eq=None, b_eq=None, bounds=None):
    """
    Solves a linear programming optimization problem using the highs algorithm.

    Parameters:
    c (list): The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
    A_ub (list): The inequality constraint matrix. Each row represents a constraint.
    b_ub (list): The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents the upper bound of the corresponding constraint.
    A_eq (list, optional): The equality constraint matrix. Each row represents a constraint.
    b_eq (list, optional): The equality constraint vector. Each element represents the required value of the corresponding constraint.
    bounds (list, optional): A list of bounds for each variable in the form (min, max).

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the optimal solution, the minimized objective function value, and the status of the optimization.
    """
    result = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, bounds=bounds, method='highs')

    return {
        'x': result.x,
        'fun': result.fun,
        'slack': result.slack,
        'success': result.success,
        'message': result.message,
        'nit': result.nit
    }
```

#### Function args_parser
The `args_parser` function parses a JSON string and extracts the arguments needed for the `linear_optimization` function. It converts the JSON data into numpy arrays and returns the arguments as a tuple.

```python
def args_parser(json_string):
    data = json.loads(json_string)
    c = np.array(data.get("c"))
    A_ub = np.array(data.get("A_ub"))
    b_ub = np.array(data.get("b_ub"))
    A_eq = np.array(data.get("A_eq")) if data.get("A_eq") is not None else None
    b_eq = np.array(data.get("b_eq")) if data.get("b_eq") is not None else None
    bounds = np.array(data.get("bounds")) if data.get("bounds") is not None else None
    args = c, A_ub, b_ub, A_eq, b_eq, bounds
    return args
```

#### Variable code_string
The `code_string` variable contains a string representation of the `linear_optimization` function. It is used to generate the code for the tutorial.

#### Variable json_schema
The `json_schema` variable contains a string representation of the JSON schema. It provides rules and guidelines for working with JSON data.

#### Variable word_problems
The `word_problems` variable is a list of word problems that will be used as prompts in the tutorial. Each word problem represents a linear programming optimization problem.

#### Variable prompt1
The `prompt1` variable contains a formatted string that prompts the user to identify various components of the first word problem. It asks for the type of problem, the objective function, the constraints, the variables, and the bounds.

#### Variable prompt2
The `prompt2` variable contains a formatted string that provides the code to run the `linear_optimization` function and the JSON schema for the arguments. It also includes instructions for the user to output a JSON object with the required arguments.

#### Function main
The `main` function is the entry point. It performs the following steps:
1. Extracts relevant problem data by interacting with the Chat API and processing user messages.
2. Generates a JSON string of the arguments required for the `linear_optimization` function.
3. Parses the JSON string to obtain the arguments.
4. Calls the `linear_optimization` function with the parsed arguments.
5. Interprets the result in the context of the original problem by interacting with the Chat API.

```python
def main():
  # 1. extract relevant problem data
  print("Analyzing problem and extracting arguments...")
  chat = Chat(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)
  intermediate = chat(prompt1)['response'].strip()
  print("Intermediate Response:\n", intermediate)

  # 2. generate json string of args
  unparsed_args = chat(prompt2)['response'].strip()
  print("Unparsed args:\n", unparsed_args)

  # 3. parse the args
  print("Parsing args...")
  parsed_args = args_parser(unparsed_args)

  # 4. pass them to the linear_optimization function
  print("Running linear optimization...")
  result = linear_optimization(*parsed_args)
  print("Result:", result)

  # 5. interpret the result in the context of the original problem
  print("Interpreting result...")
  res = chat(f"Result: {result} \n\n INSTRUCTION: Interperet the result in the context of the problem. Only use data from the above result, do not infer any other data.")['response'].strip()
  print("Final Response:\n\n", res)
```

#### Running the main function
The last line of code calls the `main` function to run the tutorial.

```python
main()
```

The output of the tutorial will be displayed in the console.

## Problems and Limitations

I would not use this in any sort of production environment yet, just because it hasn't been tested. Ideally, I could find a test dataset of word problems and solutions, but after poking around the internet for a little while I couldn't find much. 

Limitations include hallucinations, particularly in the misinterpretation of context (i.e. one of the objective function coefficients has an incorrect sign) and the potential for the model to generate a solution that is not feasible (i.e. you can't have half a person).

## Moving Forward

My plan is to continue experimenting with extending large language model outputs with additional tooling. More experiments to come!
