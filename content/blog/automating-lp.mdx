## Introduction

If you just need to solve one linear programming problem, do it in Excel with the [solver add-in](). This is more of a proof of concept than a practical solution. Here's the flow:

1. Synthesize a linear programming problem with GPT-4 into a list of relevant variables and constraints.
2. Turn the list of variables and constraints into a list of arguments for a solver function, output in `json` format.
3. Parse the json into individual arguments for the solver function.
4. Pass the arguments to the solver function and return the solution.
5. Take the solution and apply it in the context of the original problem with GPT-4.

- **Total Runtime**: ~45 seconds.
- **Accuracy**: Fine for the dev/local environment, but not production.

## An Example Problem

A company makes two products (X and Y) using two machines (A and B). Each unit of X that is produced requires 50 minutes processing time on machine A and 30 minutes processing time on machine B. Each unit of Y that is produced requires 24 minutes processing time on machine A and 33 minutes processing time on machine B.

At the start of the current week there are 30 units of X and 90 units of Y in stock. Available processing time on machine A is forecast to be 40 hours and on machine B is forecast to be 35 hours.

The demand for X in the current week is forecast to be 75 units and for Y is forecast to be 95 units. Company policy is to maximize the combined sum of the units of X and the units of Y in stock at the end of the week.

Formulate the problem of deciding how much of each product to make in the current week as a linear program.
