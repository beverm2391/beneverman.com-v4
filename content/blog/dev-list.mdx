## What is Bushwhack Development?

I'm a rock climber, so I've spent a considerable amount of time in the woods. When climbing a less trafficked traditional route (this means the route has no or little fixed gear like bolts and anchors), the trail is often:
1. Not well marked
2. Overgrown
3. Covered in fallen trees and debris

Thus, if you want to get to your route, you have to `bushwhack` your way through the woods. This might include:
1. Wandering down sub trails that lead to nowhere, and then backtracking
2. Climbing over fallen trees
3. Getting scratched by thorns and branches
4. Clearing out overgrowth

But here's the best part of `bushwhacking`:
**You build the ability to look up at a cliff from the parking lot, and get there.** Even if there's no trail. Even if you've never been there before. Even if you don't know anyone who's been there before. You can get there.

## How does this relate to development?

**In development, where is the trail clearly marked?**

- At a bootcamp, where you have a curriculum and instructors telling you what problem to solve (and how to solve it)
- In school, where you have a curriculum and teachers telling you what problem to solve (and how to solve it)
- At a large company, where you have tickets and a manager or team lead telling you what problem to solve


**In development, when do we need to `bushwhack`?**

- When you have a problem that no one has solved before
- When you're trying to build a new product that's competitive, and thus fundamentally different from existing products
- When you're trying to go 0 to 1

## Why do I like the bushwhack method?

- It allows me to build a portfolio of unique projects (not TODO lists, not weather apps, not calculators)
- It allows me to make work **meaningful** via solving problems that I care about
- It creates confidence and agency in my ability to solve problems

## How to bushwhack in development

This is the first of a series of posts on how to `bushwhack`. In this post, I'll cover the first step: **The Dev List**.

### The Dev List

In climbing, before you can actually `bushwhack`, you have to find a cool cliff to climb. The average climber usually has a long list of routes they want to climb, and they're always adding to it. In development, you should have a similar list, which I call my `Dev List`. This is a list of problems that you think are interesting, and that you want to solve. Here is my current `Dev List` as of 6/15/23. It's currently 98 items long. Hopefully this will give you a taste of what it should look like. I'd advise keeping it in your phone so that you can add to it immediately when you think of something. I started this at the end of 2021. 

**You should keep and continually update a `Dev List` of problems that you want to solve.**

## Takeaways

The point is not to solve every one of these problems, but to find those that make the hard, tedious work of development **meaningful**. Hopefully you'll start your own list and find a project that feels meaningful to you.
