## Introduction

I started playing with GPT-3 in November of 2021. I quickly realized I could leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to significantly speed up the pace of my schoolwork. Out of the box, the newest Large Language Models (LLMs) can do quite a bit out of the box. They can:
1. Generate text
2. Converse
3. Answer open book questions (you provide the context in the prompt)
4. Answer closed book questions (semi-accurately)

They are essentially *complex data structures that can be queried with natural language*. When scaled up to billions of params, increased performance on un-trained benchmarks *emerges*, and we get these pseudo-intelligent feeling models like GPT-3.

However, they have drawbacks. For summarization, there's a few significant limitations.
